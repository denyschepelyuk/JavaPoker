<h1>Java Poker Project - Documentation Overview</h1>
<p>
    The Java Poker Project simulates a simplified poker game, offering a modular and easily extensible design.
    The application leverages object-oriented principles to provide clear separation between game logic, user interface,
    and utility functions.
</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>app</strong>:
        <em>Contains the main application entry point.</em> It initializes and launches the game.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>core</strong>:
        <em>Holds the primary game logic.</em> Its sub-packages include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>cards</strong>: Manages playing cards and decks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>game</strong>: Orchestrates gameplay, handling game rounds and state management via the Table and Game classes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>players</strong>: Represents the human and AI players with their betting and hand management features.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>ui</strong>:
        <em>Handles the user interface.</em> This package processes user input via the console and displays game updates.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>util</strong>:
        <em>Provides utility support.</em> It includes classes for evaluating card hands, sorting card data, and managing game configurations.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>
    The design of the Java Poker Project is centered on a modular approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Modular Packages:</strong> Each package focuses on a specific area of responsibility,
        ensuring that game logic, user interaction, and utility functions are well separated.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Game Mechanics:</strong> The <em>core</em> package manages the gameplay, including shuffling
        and dealing cards, managing betting rounds, and determining the game winner.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>User Interface:</strong> The <em>ui</em> package encapsulates the logic required for user interaction,
        such as input handling and game status display.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Utilities:</strong> The <em>util</em> package facilitates operations like hand evaluation and configuration management,
        making the core game logic more maintainable.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    The application is launched via the <strong>app.App</strong> class, which contains the <code>main</code>
    method. On execution, a new game is initialized, and the game loop begins, allowing for player interaction
    via a command-line interface.
</p>

<h2>Additional Documentation</h2>
<p>
    This documentation is generated using the Maven Javadoc Plugin. It includes comprehensive API details for
    each package and class, facilitating a deeper understanding of the implementation.
